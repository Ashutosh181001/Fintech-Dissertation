# Crypto Anomaly Detection - Deployment Script Commands

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive list of commands for the `crypto-deploy.sh` script, which handles the complete deployment and management of a crypto anomaly detection system on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` installed and configured
- `docker` installed
- Active Kubernetes cluster connection
- Appropriate GCP permissions for the project

---

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Primary Deployment
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh build-deploy
```
**Description**: Build new Docker images and deploy the complete system from scratch. This is the most comprehensive deployment option.

**Use when**: 
- First-time deployment
- Code changes require new images
- Complete system refresh needed

---

### Quick Deployment
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh deploy
# OR
./crypto-deploy.sh start
```
**Description**: Deploy system using existing Docker images. Faster than `build-deploy` as it skips the image building process.

**Use when**: 
- Images are already built and available
- Quick restart after system stop
- Configuration-only changes

---

### Rolling Update
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh update
```
**Description**: Perform rolling update of all components without rebuilding images. Zero-downtime deployment.

**Use when**: 
- System is running and needs restart
- Configuration changes applied
- Want to refresh without full rebuild

---

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### System Status
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh status
```
**Description**: Show comprehensive system status including:
- Deployment status
- Pod health and resource usage
- Service availability
- Storage information
- Performance metrics
- Quick anomaly detection statistics

**Output includes**:
- üóÇÔ∏è Deployments status
- üöÄ Pods status and locations
- üåê Services and networking
- üíæ Storage utilization
- ‚ö° Performance mode indicator
- üìà Real-time metrics (trades processed, anomalies detected)

---

### Live Logs
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh logs
```
**Description**: Interactive log viewer with options:
1. All components (parallel)
2. Producer only
3. Detector only  
4. Dashboard only
5. Recent Kubernetes events

**Features**:
- Real-time log streaming
- Component-specific filtering
- Event troubleshooting

---

### Dashboard Access
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh dashboard
```
**Description**: Creates port-forward to access the Streamlit dashboard locally.

**Access**: `http://localhost:8501`

**Features**:
- Real-time anomaly visualization
- Trading data analysis
- System performance metrics
- Interactive charts and graphs

---

### Data Download
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh data
```
**Description**: Downloads performance and benchmark data from the running system.

**Downloads**:
- `trading_anomalies.db` - SQLite database with all data
- `performance_log.csv` - Detailed performance metrics
- `benchmark_summary.json` - System performance summary
- Creates timestamped backup directory
- Updates latest files for quick access

---

## üîÑ Management Commands

### System Restart
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh restart
```
**Description**: Gracefully restart all system components by scaling down to 0 replicas, then back to 1.

**Process**:
1. Scale deployments to 0
2. Wait for pod termination
3. Scale back to 1 replica each
4. Wait for readiness
5. Show updated status

---

### System Stop
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh stop
```
**Description**: Stop the system with data preservation options.

**Interactive options**:
1. **Keep all data** (recommended) - Preserves database and secrets
2. **Delete database only** - Removes storage but keeps Kafka credentials  
3. **Delete everything** - Complete cleanup including secrets

**Use when**: 
- Maintenance required
- Cost optimization (stopping compute)
- Troubleshooting storage issues

---

### Complete Cleanup
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh clean
```
**Description**: Nuclear option - deletes the entire Kubernetes namespace and all associated resources.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This removes ALL data, configurations, and secrets permanently.

**Use when**: 
- Project decommissioning
- Complete fresh start needed
- Development environment reset

---

### Help
```bash
./crypto-deploy.sh help
# OR
./crypto-deploy.sh
```
**Description**: Display comprehensive help information with usage examples and command descriptions.
